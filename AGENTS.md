# Agent guide

TokenTV draws AI usage limits on a 240×240 desk clock. Python 3.10+, Pillow, no other runtime deps.

## Run without accounts or a clock

```bash
pip install -e .
token-tv demo --out token-tv-demo     # every face from sample data
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Set up TokenTV for the user

When the user says "Set up TokenTV for me":

1. Install: `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e .` (Windows: `.venv\Scripts\pip install -e .`),
   or with Node only: `npx github:yethihahtwe/token-tv demo`.
2. Ask the user for the clock's IP address (shown on the clock's screen).
3. Run `.venv/bin/token-tv start --device-url <ip>`. It finds the Claude, Codex and Grok CLIs that are already
   signed in, reads each account's email through the official login, asks the user to confirm, saves the
   config and opens the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8787. The user then presses Clock display → Apply.
4. If it says nothing is signed in, tell the user to sign in to the CLI they use (e.g. `claude`, then /login)
   and run step 3 again. A second account of the same service: `.venv/bin/token-tv connect --account <key>`.

Verified on Linux with one SD_PRO clock and one SmallTV-Ultra (Ultra-V9.0.54). Mac and Windows hosts are untested; report what fails.

## Change how things look

- Clock faces: `docs/clock-faces.md` (one Python function per face, sample data, `token-tv demo`).
- Web dashboard: themes are listed in `THEMES` in `token_tv/web/app.js` and styled with
  `[data-theme=<id>]` rules in `token_tv/web/style.css`. Copy an existing theme's rules to start.
- More services: `docs/adding-a-provider.md`.

## Rules

- Never read, print or copy credential files (`.credentials.json`, `auth.json`, Keychain items) or
  real config files. Tests use `token_tv/sample.py` and temporary folders.
- Do not publish, push, open issues or create releases on the user's behalf.
- A missing reading is a dash, an old one is marked OLD. Never turn unknown into `0`.
- `token-tv setup --yes --<provider>-email ...` is non-interactive and never overwrites a config.
  `token-tv doctor --live` contacts providers; ask the user before running it.

## Make a clock face

Follow `docs/clock-faces.md`: write a render function, add it to `RENDERERS` and `STYLES`, render
with `token-tv demo`, and look at the 240×240 result at real size. It then appears in the dashboard's
Themes list as a Local face and can be applied to the clock without any upstream change.
